        This is the core method that initiates tool .py files execution.

        Any specific files you need can be in the same directory with this main.py or in subdirs
        with appropriate import statements with respect to dir structure.

        Any logic you implement here is going to be copied inside your tool image when 
        you build it using docker build or the provided Makefile.
        
            The MinIO initialization that is given down below is an example you may use it or not.
            MinIO access credentials are in the form of <ACCESS ID, ACCESS KEY, SESSION TOKEN>
            and are generated upon the OAuth 2.0 token of the user executing the tool. 

            For development purpose you may define your own credentials for your local MinIO
